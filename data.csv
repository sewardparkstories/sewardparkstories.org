Scene I (Pinoy Hill in Seward Park, Seattle. 1957. Three picnic tables placed in a row. The table at one end is marked with a RESERVED sign. A teen boy sprawls across the center table.)

MAX:  (Acts bored. Swears.) Why me? So unfair. (Pounds table.) It’s the same every year. Boring. Same old dances. Same old table. Same music. Same faces.  BORING! (Lies down on bench next to table and closes eyes.)

An older Pinay woman (late-forties to early fifties) enters. She carries a shopping bag. Noticing him, she makes disgusted grunting and grumbling noises and mutters as she puts the bag on the remaining, unreserved table.)

ROSARIO: Psst! Psst!

MAX: (Doesn’t respond. Ignores her.)

ROSARIO: Psst! Halo! Magandang umaga sa iyo! (Max continues to ignore her.)  Boy!  I said “Halo!”

MAX: I don’t understand Filipino. An’ I’m not a boy.

ROSARIO: Oh, American-born. I see.  I said “Hello. Good morning.”

MAX: (Sits up.) Can I help you?

ROSARIO: Are you saving that table?  I would like it.

MAX: (Stands)  No can do, Auntie.

ROSARIO: Ha?  Why “no can do”?  You’re the only one here. You use it just for sleep. My family is coming.

MAX: My dad would kill me if I gave up this table. I’m saving it for my family. It’s his orders.","An excerpt from ""Pinoy Hill,"" a play by Robert Francis Flor",Pinoy Hill - A Play,"Thomas Bancroft, 2014",47.551975,-122.255494,,culture
